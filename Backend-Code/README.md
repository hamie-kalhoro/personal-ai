# Backend Code

The backend code for this project is maintained in a separate repository.

🔗 **[View Backend Code Repository](https://github.com/hamie-kalhoro/gemini-ai)**

This folder serves as a reference point. All backend development, code, and documentation can be found in the [gemini-ai repository](https://github.com/hamie-kalhoro/gemini-ai).

## Why a Separate Repository?

The backend is maintained separately to allow for:
- Independent development and deployment
- Separate version control and release cycles
- Focused repository management for frontend and backend teams

For any backend-related questions, issues, or contributions, please visit the [gemini-ai repository](https://github.com/hamie-kalhoro/gemini-ai).
